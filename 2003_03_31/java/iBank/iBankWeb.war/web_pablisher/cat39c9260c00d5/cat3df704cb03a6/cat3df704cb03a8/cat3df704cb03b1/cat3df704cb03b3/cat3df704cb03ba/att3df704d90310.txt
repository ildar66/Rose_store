This attribute contains the state of the IBank system.
See the two IBank state diagrams for more information.
We flattened the two diagrams: The 'In Use' state is not retained, 
instead we promote the substates of it to become states of the IBank.
IBankState is an innerclass, all possible values for 'state' are static fields on the IBank.
