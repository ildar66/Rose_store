Given a string, this method replaces all occurrences of
'<' with '&lt;', all occurrences of '>' with
'&gt;', and (to handle cases that occur inside attribute
values), all occurrences of double quotes with
'&quot;' and all occurrences of '&' with '&amp;'.
Without such filtering, an arbitrary string
could not safely be inserted in a Web page.
