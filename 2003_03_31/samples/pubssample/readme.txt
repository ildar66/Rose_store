This sample shows how to use the "ADO Class" template for Visual Basic 
classes in Rational Rose. The "ADO Class" template helps you create 
data aware classes that are using ADO to access the database. To browse 
the sample model, open the PubsSample.mdl model in Rose and follow
the instructions.

A Visual Basic project, called PubsSample.vbp, has been generated from
the model. You can browse the code by opening the project file in Visual
Basic 6. 

Note that the application collects information from the "Pubs" database,
which is delivered with Microsoft SQL Server. Thus, in order to run the 
application you must have access to that database.

You also need to set up a DSN called "PubsDSN" on your computer. That
done, you can run the application by clicking Start on the Run menu in
Visual Basic.
